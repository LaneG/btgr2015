                <p class="abstract">Two years ago, Mighty in the Midwest, a Grand Rapids web design and development company, hired me as their full-time content strategist and copywriter. Mine was a new role on a small team that, until that time, had consisted only of designers and developers. It was a bold move and a major shift for a small company. But we did it build on our strengths and bring more balance to our team, our process, and our services. Naturally, our process had to change. I was the eighth person to join the team; since then, the team has grown to thirteen, and our process has continued to evolve. I'd like to share my experience as the lone content strategist and copywriter on a team of designers and developers and what we've learned along the way.

                <h2>May I Present Balance Team: <br />Introducing Enterprise companies to Balanced Team techniques</h2>
                <p class="abstract">Over the past year I've worked with a bunch of big enterprise, corporate companies who want to "do agile" development.

                    At Pivotal we believe not in 'doing agile' but 'being agile.'  Intrinsic in that philosophy are teams that have seamless communication through various disciplines.  As we bring in small corporate teams to work with us on projects, the biggest eye opener for them is what happens when you break down the walls.  So we as teachers have to work in our balanced teams with an eye toward teaching and demonstrating.  It's got to be balanced teams x10.

                    I'd like to talk about this process, the challenges that come with having to be our highest selves, what the corporate teams have the hardest time with, what processes we use to bring them onboard, and what happens when they leave the nest and go back to their offices.</p>

            <h2>Story Mapping 2015</h2>
            <p class="abstract">For this balanced team audience many may be aware of the practice of Story Mapping, but it may be new to some. The biggest change for me is finally seeing stories and story mapping really bridge communication boundaries between engineers, UX people, and product people. I'll to talk about how 10 years ago this seemed like a pipe dream, but today it's becoming understood that that's the purpose of stories in software, and story mapping in particular.</p>

            <p class="abstract">In college I was part of 764-HELP, the university's tech support number. It gave me immense empathy for regular people suffering from bad software.

From a family of developers and entrepreneurs, I started writing code
at 12.  I’ve since filled many roles, but for the last 15 years I’ve
alternated between leading the technical side of ambitious products and
advising others on how to make systems and teams run well. To learn more about me, a good place to start is my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/williampietri">LinkedIn
profile</a>.  I comment
occasionally <a href="http://twitter.com/williampietri">on Twitter</a>,
and even more occasionally post to a <a href="http://agilefocus.com/author/william/">group blog on Agile

            <h2>Everyone Should be a Scientist</h2>
            <p class="abstract">
            	The scientific method something that we often think about as reserved for laboratories and social experiments. Over the past few years the Lean Hypothesis has made it's way into design thinking, but all members of a software development team can employ scientific techniques. If we all conducted good experiments which generate conclusive evidence, we would be able to make more data backed decisions. From product managers and designers to the engineers that build the software, there is always an opportunity to use the fundamentals of hypothesis driven testing. It's more than just the practice, there's a mindset that goes along with experimentation that helps yield great results.
